### Discussion and notes

**General notes**

**Breakout notes**

*The Data Store*

*In small groups discuss the following questions:*

1. How might you use the Data Store in your work?
2. Does the data store allow your data to be FAIR?
3. What is one way you could use the data store in FOSS for your group work?

**Team/Room A**
- Peggy Biga
- Nicole Riddle
- Serhat Turkmen
- Phil Collender
- Khalid Freij 

1. Share large data sets, collaborate on data, short-term data storage, version control, one stop for data usage
2. Yes! Findable- yes, with DOI; Accessible- free accounts at CyVese, make community available; Interoperable- context dependent; Reproducible- yes, as public
3. Collaboration, sharing data, add meta data to make it searchable,

1- How might you use the Data Store in your work?
- Storing data for paper, code, etc.
- Share data (with public, anonymous, or CyVerse users)
- Get DOI number for publications

2- Does the data store allow your data to be FAIR?
- Yes
- Metadata templates are available for the data

3- What is one way you could use the data store in FOSS for your group work?

1. How might you use the Data Store in your work? 
    - Sharing files
    - version control
    - back-up
    - localized place to keep work
3. Does the data store allow your data to be FAIR?  
Gives you the tools, but you have to implement the tools. 
    - findable: somewhat, but no doi and not registered or indexed in a searchable resource to our understanding
    - accesible: yes, cyverse is free and just need an account. permissions may limit this though? Ease of access may mean *yes* its open. 
    - interoperable: a well written metadata will allow for data interoperable
    - reusable: if its open beyond just lab members, but ?clear and accessible data usage license? 
5. What is one way you could use the data store in FOSS for your group work?
    - made for collaboration, sort of a more organized Google Drive, we can share files and code through FOSS for group work.

Question 1: File and Data sharing. (Questions about how to store sensitive data on CyVerse? Is it secture)

Question 2: It is FAIR if you have a CyVerse acc. However, those who want to access and use the data used in the Data Store would have to have a CyVerse acc (and pay for it?) This makes the Data store not fully FAIR. 

Question 3: It is a good way for collaborative work. There would need to be a open access folder where only team members have ability to create/manipulate/work on data within the folder. 



### Team/Room E 
- Clara Qin
- Amy Schuler
- Mery Touceda-Suarez
- Emily Quach
- Emily Dart

1. How might you use the Data Store in your work?
   - Backing up data
   - Easily porting data into CyVerse Apps
   - Way to share data with colaborators and manage access
2. Does the Data Store allow your data to be FAIR?
   - Not necessarily – it depends!
   - You can make a community data folder that others could access (Accessible)
   - Findability could be limiting because data isn't searchable
   - Interoperability and Reusability depend on the metadata you include in the folder
3. What is one way you could use the data store in FOSS for your group work?
   - It's easier to share raw data and results with group members
   - Takes memory demand and computing demand off of your own computer
   - Institutional HPCs sometimes have external sharing restrictions; Data Store makes this more flexible
   - Facilitates reproducibility – CyVerse gets around versioning issues


**Team/Room F**
-Chai-Shian Kua, Kyle Johnsen, Julia Piaskowski, Ferris Saad, Farah, Charlie Li   
1. How might you use the Data Store in your work?

To share data for usage with cyverse apps, no really a place for FAIR data access. Not the best backup. Not a long-term data storage solution. This is for analysis. 

2. Does the data store allow your data to be FAIR?

No, it's not very accessible.Like any cloud data storage solution, it appears to be largely unregulated. (we have TOS).  

3. What is one way you could use the data store in FOSS for your group work?

Easy to share since we all have accounts and know how to use it. How easily does it connect to cyverse apps? Hopefully very easily to enable quick analyses. 


Team/Room G
1. How might you use the Data Store in your work?
    Currently using the Data store for training using smaller datasets to introduce Cyverse. 

2. Does the data store allow your data to be FAIR?
    Yes, but share work via other avenues. 


3. What is one way you could use the data store in FOSS for your group work?
    Enable easy analysis and cooperation between our team members.
