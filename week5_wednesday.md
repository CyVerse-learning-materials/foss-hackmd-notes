### Discussion and notes

**General notes**

Capstone I starts this week, we will be working in teams to share data management plans with each other using the website materials discussed in today's class. Ultimately, you will make a page for your team describing your team members, link to the person's data management plan, etc.

Capstone II will extend Capstone I to include 1-2 other open science tools beyond the data management plan. This could include hosting open science tools in the same GitHub repo, making an OSF page for your team, integrating a tool on CyVerse, revising & reposting your data management plans, etc. 

*The capstones are what you make of them.*

**Breakout notes**

*Question 1: What are the GitHub issues that you all found for homework? What did you notice about them?* 

Team A:Khalid, Phil, Nicole
A covid agent-based model (covasim) - Mostly internal feature development with sparse commentary
record linkage R package (fastlink) -  a few sparse user reported issues with rapid response from package maintainers
Freedatacamp - had lots of reported issues, but they were being resolved in a timely manner. 

Team B: Austin, Reza, Ariyan, Kangsan
* Below are issues from creating a github page from the breakout room 
    * First pull and then commit (Pull the latest changes on the repository before commiting the new changes)
    * Misspellings and typing errors on the github edit page are not captured.
    * Choosing the correct branch for editing the github pages contents.
* Looking at GitHub issues for last weeks hw
    * A lot of issues reported, mostly on renaming functions or expanding tool documentation to be clearer
    * Some issues raised on adding new tool functionality, some repo maintainers would comment on the idea but didn't really solve these find of issues unless super easy

Team C: Marisa Gonzalez, Javier Osorio, Connel Ching'anda
* Readme files are often not sufficiently detailed. So, it is hard for people figure out how or where to start
* The naming of the code is often confusing
* Sometimes Github pages only contain code and there is no documentation
* In other cases the documentation is hard to follow
* Sometimes, it is hard to navigate the folder structure of complex repocitories



Team D: Tristan, Athan, Ida, and Monsur. Since we are fairly new to GitHub, we dont use the issues very often, or stay up to date on them. Issues dicuss problems or cofussion regarding the purpose/functionality of the repo and propmote developer/user communication.

Team E: Bugs, user questions, documentation requests, feature requests

Team F:
* CSKua
* kjjohnsen
* charlie-BSAIL
* fsaa2021
* FarahSaeed
* jpiaskowski


mixture of legit comments such as how to use the tools, documentation/readme file not clear, maintainers are nicer to folks raising issues than in the past (code of conducts might actually be working)


Team G:

*Question 2: Have you created websites for projects in the past? What did you use?*

Team A:Khalid, Phil, Nicole
Khalid and Phil haven't created websites in the past.
Nicole has used wiki pages for sample tracking between laboratories and to the data analysis labs.  
Nicole has also been in labs that use websites for public-facing efforts, ie broader impacts for NSF. 



Team B: Austin, Reza, Ariyan, Kangsan
- Austin: No. Have tried before on GitHub but ran into issues and gave up. 
- Ariyan: Yes. HTML page hosted on our lab machine. 

Team C: Most of us have a github account but have no used it in a long time and have never created a website. 

Team D: Used HTML, CSS, JS, React, NodeJS, Heroku. Some have never made a website. Wordpress.  

Team E:Used HTML, CSS, GitHub Wiki, Drupal 

Team F: html, Yes, some of us have - thru github pages, thru jekyll, hugo + netlify, wordpress, drupal (shudder)

Team G: html, iWeb, Wordpress
