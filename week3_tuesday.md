Questions on the Data Store:

In small groups discuss the following questions:

1. How might you use the Data Store in your work?
2. Does the data store allow your data to be FAIR?
3. What is one way you could use the data store in FOSS for your team work?

Feel free to leave [feedback on the DE2 Data Store](https://sonora.cyverse.org/help)

[Team 1]
1.How might you use the Data Store in your work?

-Sharing and storing data for later analysis
Manging permissions until release

2.Does the data store allow your data to be FAIR?
-Findable: yes, if organized and shared accurately
-Accessible: yes, once appropriate. Manage accessibility for when you want to make it available. Documentation important: needed to make sense of data
-Interoperable: User dependant (user needs to prepare data for this). Need to know where data came from and how it was prepared and original use of it
-Reusable: others able to read data? Use of data as supplemental info from manuscript

How is data marketed/promoted?

3.What is one way you could use the data store in FOSS for your team work?

Team 2
1. When weâ€™ve collected data we can store it in the Data Store where the data is accessible to all who have the proper permissions
2. Yes, the data store helps with findability through search, accessibility through downloads, interoperability by exchanging information and data and reuse of digital assets
3. Every time one of the team members wants to share some data we can upload it to the Data Store and share it with members.

Team 3
In small groups discuss the following questions:

1. How might you use the Data Store in your work?
- Good way to access data used by the entire group (helps with accessibility)
2. Does the data store allow your data to be FAIR?
- Yes, it allows for data to be findable and accessed easily (Not too sure about the IR part yet)
3. What is one way you could use the data store in FOSS for your group work?
> []- Able to access files created by one another (we can also make changes to the data and see who modified it)
--> Cyverse allows for fast data downloading compared to other forms of data storage

Team 4 

1. How might you use the Data Store in your work?

Storing files and scripts for sharing with external collaborators

2. Does the data store allow your data to be FAIR?

Some barriers to entry/learning curve reduce accessibility

3. What is one way you could use the data store in FOSS for your group work?

Storing our documents where we can all access, share, edit, etc.

Team 5 
How might Data Store be helpful in our work? AND How does the Data Store promote FAIRness in data?
* Bob: uses Data Store extensively already
* Yiluan: useful for large, remotely sensed data sets; structure and organization are useful; open access to code as well as data is critical
* Bob: CyVerse is a platform for long-term data storage; perhaps not necessarily archiving data
* Limitations with Data Store in accessibility to broader community?
* Clearer permissions/easier sharing than Google Drive
