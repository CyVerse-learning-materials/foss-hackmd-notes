### Discussion and notes

Just a few points for each question - enough to get a sense for what people in 

You can make bullet points with `-` at the beginning of a line. Adding an empty line can help make text that is not bulleted easier to read when hackMD converts the format. 

**Room 1** 
- Q1 - Surveys and text
- Q2 - GBs and TBs
It takes days to days
- Q3 - Drovebox, Google drive, Box, GitHub
- Q4 - Using Apps to collect the information, so noone has to introduce it manually into a computer
- Q5 - Excel and Notepad

**Room 2**
- Q1: Sequencing, animal and plant behavior, imaging (animal brains & satellite), questionnaire and health data

- Q2: Large--TBs

- Q3: Box

- Q4: Beyond basic QC, we do not really have one

- Q5: 

**Room 3**

2 or 3 data types:
- Genomic
- Meteorological data
- Carbon flux
- Environmental variables
- Air quality
- LIDAR data (canopy structure, biodiversity)
- Image data
- Text, numeric data

What is the scale of your data? (Volume, Files themselves, Velocity, Variety):
- Kayla: Relatively small, 3-4 spreadshseets per summer, 4-5 variables
- Ayanna: Hard to answer, several Mb large, two types - raw data
- Justina: 5 parameters, one uniform data type from mobile data sensors: Mb-scale
- Nick: 60 Students producing 6 images per lab
- Jesse: Mb to Gb scale, velocity not that 

Strategies for storing/backing up:
- Kayla: Google drive to github
- Ayanna: Github, boxdrive
- Nick: Google drive
- Justina: Google drive
- Jesse: NCBI, OSF, github to some extent

Verifying integrity:
- Kayla: Openrefine, data range values against standard
- Ayanna: For rice data, use standards to make sure within range, for NEON already QC'd
- Justina: Just started, not yet working on big data. Only use data from peer-reviewed journals
- Nick: Would like to get to this
- Jesse: Visualizing data to see if anything is wonky

Searching for data:
- Pubmed / google scholar


**Room 4**

Data types:
- MRI data - 50GB - 2/secs
- Genetic snips
- Public opinion data - couple of GB - monthly
- Social media
- Economic 
- Aerial photography - 1TB - annual

Storage:
- Dropbox
- Google Cloud
- Google BigQuery

Integrity:
- Preprocess by scientist
- Share raw data


**Room 5:** lots of plant biologists but also other research types
* genomics data, leaf physiology
* data scale: gigabytes to terabytes
* some databases used; some raw files
* field data + sequencing data
* data storage on departmental servers, Google Drive, R packages
* searching data: Excel



**Room 6:**
- Question 1 - Large amounts of images, point cloud data, environmental data, spectral data

- Question 2 - 10 TB a day

- Question 3 - CyVerse infrastructure, commons and data store. We also have structured metadata

- Question 4 - Data is protected with user privileges. Not too sure, but we are told it's protected

- Question 5 - All raw data has unique identifier and we use metdata to identify. Time stamps are also in the file names

- Question 6 - Shared through CyVerse. Using user interfaces to aid in visualisation. Dockarized and containerized code.
