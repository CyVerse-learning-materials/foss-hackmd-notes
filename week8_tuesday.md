### Discussion and notes

**General notes**

In opening breakouts, do your best as a team to try and answer the follwing questions (all related to the tutorial)


1. What is the point of starting a GitHub repository at the start of the project? What will you be doing with this? 

2. What differences can you name between
 
   a. installing Conda
   
   b. using Conda to install other tools? 

3. What is the difference between using a tool installed with Conda vs. using a tool in a Docker container? 

4. What is the point of copying data to the datastore (end of the section "Computer and project setup with Github, Conda, and the Data Store")

**Breakout notes**

Team 1
1. What is the point of starting a GitHub repository at the start of the project? What will you be doing with this? 

interactivity with team members
ensure reproducibility

2. What differences can you name between
 
   a. installing Conda
   
   actually installs conda
   
   b. using Conda to install other tools? 


3. What is the difference between using a tool installed with Conda vs. using a tool in a Docker container? 

unsure of the difference

4. What is the point of copying data to the datastore (end of the section "Computer and project setup with Github, Conda, and the Data Store")

Able to upload large amounts of data
Can share data, allow reproducibility



Team 2


* Starting a GitHub repository at the beginnning of a project allows team members to have a central place for documentation and access to the data and code for the project
* It also allows to keep track of changes made by any member of the team

2. What differences can you name between
 
   a. installing Conda
   
       Conda allows the user to install other tools
   
   b. using Conda to install other tools? 
   
4. What is the point of copying data to the datastore (end of the section "Computer and project setup with Github, Conda, and the Data Store")
    a. To keep a uniform version of the data secure
 
Team 3
1. What is the point of starting a GitHub repository at the start of the project? What will you be doing with this? 
    **Github helps with data management. You can track your code and track changes. Helps you start your research out well by helping to maintain FAIR principles. There's a possibility of automating the script and making it into Docker container.**

2. What differences can you name between
 
   a. installing Conda: comes equipped with packages (preloaded).
   **Has an image.  You can install specific versons of your softwear.   Reduces hastles of getting versions.**
   
   b. using Conda to install other tools?

3. What is the difference between using a tool installed with Conda vs. using a tool in a Docker container? 
**Conda hold packages and docker holds repositories containers.**

4. What is the point of copying data to the datastore (end of the section "Computer and project setup with Github, Conda, and the Data Store")

Team 4

Team 5
Q1:
* to keep track of (version-control) a project, especially a shared project
* Good for managing a project or collaborating, and for getting an overview of the project's goals or project management
* Could be used with things like Jupyter notebooks as a way to have version control

Q2:
* Conda is a package manager, and can allow you to create isolated environments that have specific packages installed.

Q3:

### Homework Reminders

- Continue to work through the Reproducibility Tour
- Copy the Reproducibility Tutorial onto your CyVerse DataStore (do this each time you...since #scratch space gets deleted when using a VM)
