### Discussion and notes

**General notes**

Capstone I starts this week, we will be working in teams to share data management plans with each other using the website materials discussed in today's class. Ultimately, you will make a page for your team describing your team members, link to the person's data management plan, etc.

Capstone II will extend Capstone I to include 1-2 other open science tools beyond the data management plan. This could include hosting open science tools in the same GitHub repo, making an OSF page for your team, integrating a tool on CyVerse, revising & reposting your data management plans, etc. 

*The capstones are what you make of them.*

**Breakout notes**

*Question 1: What are the GitHub issues that you all found for homework? What did you notice about them?* 

Team 1


Team 2

We looked up issues relating to the Purpleair sensor that a member of our group has used in her research. There was documentation of an issue relateing to the sensor disconnecting from the internet. In general, it seemed like a really helpful tool for addressing issues that can arise in the course of working with software or hardware and seeing what other people have dealt with in the past.


Team 3

Looked at issues of downloading Dada2 on windows. Have to download cutadapt for it to work and make sure python is downloaded.

Team 4

Reviewed the instructions for installing a package and the instructions were outdated. Submitted an issue that the instructions were unclear, and they responded with updated instructions and the issue was resolved.
