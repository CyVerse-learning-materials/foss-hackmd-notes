### Homework Reminders

- Go through the questions on the Intro to Reproducible Science tutorial: https://learning.cyverse.org/projects/cyverse-foss/en/latest/reproducible_science/intro.html
- Think about how you would make the workflow/tools you use in your domain reproducible (if not doing genomics as in the example)
- Find out what license(s) your institution recommends (or requires)for your code and research data?
- Think about your answers to the Data Management exercise above (as we'll start off with this next week in your team breakout)
