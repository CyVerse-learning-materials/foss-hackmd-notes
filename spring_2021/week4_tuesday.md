### Discussion and notes

**General notes**

*Self Assessment Questions*

1. Thinking about the data you work with, can you identify any areas where it would be good to apply FAIR principles?

2. Do you see a path using the tools we have used so far to get you closer to being FAIR?

**Breakout notes**

Team 1
    Thinking about the data you work with, can you identify any areas where it would be good to apply FAIR principles?
    Looking at ways to collaborate better, setting up environments to improve reproducabiity


Do you see a path using the tools we have used so far to get you closer to being FAIR?
    Have better understanding of the tools that are available, but not sure how we will use these or what they will be used for. 
    Containers to improve reproducability with collaborators/people reading papers


Team 2

1. Working with data aggregated from governemnt agencies it would be helpful to apply FAIR principles in its analysis so that it is transparent and reproducible. 
2. Having a data management plan in place and having a central place to store data and analyses would be a starting point for incorporating FAIR principles into our work

Team 3 

1. Working with data management documents. There is a need to be able to find colaborative data that can be reproduced easily. 
- Mark down to begin to comment on code (helps with understanding of code and makes data reproducible)
- Currently on excel, but other tools would help with the future of the student. Helping with their research.
- Already working with data in CyVersee. Find, share, and download data.

2. You can find the data easily if you give the path, but it can be hard if the data is not structured well. It is all good and dandy until you have no idea what is going on.
- F and A is not only limited to the tools, but also the rules, format, etc.
- Start off with a good foundation and it will be better for you. 
- Labeling data is important.Use github because it helps you statw your parameters and other things necessary for performing your analysis.


Team 4
1. It is not easy for a new team member to understand how a lab works. Typically, one person collecting the data and all the others working with the data. Thus, FAIR principles are important to facilitate collaboration (e.g., using the same environment).

Making all datasets/metadata within a lab usable and analyzable by everyone who needs them.

Clarifying coding decisions so people revisiting analyses later can understand all code.

2. Still need to see it in action to better understand how to implement it in our research. 

Collaborating with people without an HPC, e.g., can run computationally demanding analyses with cyverse tools.

Team 5

1. Lisa: Findability is present in data (DOI), but maybe not easy to find or acessible. 
   Kayla: Make more accessible metadata file from a standard template so it is easily translated for yourself later and for others. 
2. Build skills in Jypter (spelling) notebook. 
   Carla: Concerns about this platform: What about data storage in this platform?
   Lisa: Need to know more about intermediate data storage. How to move data from active handling to longer term storage. 
   Carla: Try HackMD in classroom
