## Collaborative Notes

***For Breakout Discussions***

**Q1: What does Open Science mean to you?**
- Rm 1: Open-access datasets, with detailed meta-data, updates with new releases and maybe publications that explain methodology to produce the dataset. Easy to find, download and use. Points of contact for questions
- Rm 2: Include open source code that is open to the public. Providing documentation, meta-data, basically providing everything that someone would need to understand the data. Easy to find data - plus easy to find and inclusive tutorials. 
- Rm 3: Provide enough info for work to be reproducible and so that others can do it. Related to open access, its not proprietary, data and tools to be out in the open
- Rm 4: Internal training/protocols as well as external communications to allow someone to repeat/corroborate your work. Accessibility of data including methods and code, to others beyond your group.

**Q2: What characteristics might be required for a project/product/process to be Open?**
- Rm 1: Code and data, but need to be cleaned up enough to be usable
- Rm 2: Machine readable data that is easy to read.  Widely accessible file types.  Making it widely available and findable. Providing full information on what software is used and the version, how the data was collected, analysis ready data, data that can be read from the cloud.  Creating containers of the environment. 
- Rm 3: provide a reproducibility report to include enough detail so someone can recreate the work in the publication, list all the tools you use, make sure you use the same versions of software, list order in which to use scripts, step 1 may not really be step 1, there is a lot of cleaning that goes on before "step 1", 
- Rm 4: Often dictated by the publisher of particular journals: GenBank numbers, analysis code. But also includes the steps in all stages of the data cycle, including interim analysis steps. Standards that allow for interoperability, common repositories.

**Q3: What are some challenges in your domain/lab to doing Open Science?**
- Rm 1: Houshold data surveys, it's a lot of work to clean it up and make it private but usable. Rush to publish means it's not always easiest to make things clean and nice as you go. You could get scooped if you open data up before publication! People might illegally collect rare plants if you geotag a specimen
- Rm 2: Not a lot of understanding of Open Science, hard to get support and other people onboard. Privacy and intellecutal property.  Time. 
- Rm 3: Is the Methods section helpful in making the publciation reproducibile? What about a dump from a shell terminal? Sometimes data cannot be shared. Professor does not want to share code proprietary to group. Open Science takes more time. If more journals asked for reports, more people would be the time in to document the publication. 
- Rm 4:

**Q4: What motivates you to do OS?**
- Rm 1:
- Rm 2: Role of data in politics, good for the community to access and interpret the data. Opening it to the public but some data is confidential. Inclusion but we also get better science with more eyes looking at it. Sharing unusual data sets with those who may not be able to pursue a specific project.  
- Rm 3: The idea that I can prove that my work is reproducible, Ia m letting other people test/validate my work. It is common in some fields (CS) to share code and in Science it is moving in that direction. It is important to make sure data is available so that everyone can run the same analysis and get the same results. I want others to do open science so I can benefit from it. Raises accountability and clarity on complex models.
- Rm 4:Open Science make things more reproducible and efficient, thus it is easier to train and teach other people to use the tools/pipelines required for the job.

**Q5: Which of the 5 schools do you fall into?**
- Rm 1:
- Rm 2: Democratic - share data and allow for improvements. Measurement - talked about sharing data pre/post publications.  
- Rm 3: A little of all of them, they all have good points
- Rm 4: Pragmatic, to save time, to be efficient, not repeat errors. Democratic, to share wisdom and allow for improvements from others. Ability to be interdisciplinary important to some fields (such as biology & computation), allows for sharing and increased output, better way to do outreach.

**Q6: Are there any motivating factors that don't fit into any of the 5 categories (your opinion)?**
- Rm 1:
- Rm 2: Black box issue, 
- Rm 3: Room 2 ^^^^^^, 
- Rm 4:Research data management with industrial partners is a challenge; how to integrate private sphere with academic viewpoint.

## Questions

Use this section to ask questions, which one of the instructors will try to answer. If you are having issues getting something to work, directly message one of them in the `#2021fallteam` Slack channel. 

These questions could range from clarification on some jargon to 

Format your question as a bullet point, an instructor will add a response as a sub-point, like this:

- Whatâ€™s a computer?
    - A rock we taught to do math
- Is there a limit in the amount of resources that you can use thorugh the Discovery Environment (an amount of node-hours per month or something like that)?
