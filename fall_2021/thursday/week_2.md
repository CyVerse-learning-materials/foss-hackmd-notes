## Breakout Discussion questions & notes

*Questions from slides on project management*

### Q1: What experiences have you all had with project management?

**Room 1:** 
Wide variety of experience with project management, just getting started and/or feeling like there would be ways to do it better. Also, experience with managing documentation. A daily log of what has tasks/tasks completed is very helpful. Field notebooks can get messy - protocols would be more consistent. Tools: Overleaf, Google Drive, GitHub, dropbox, and Trello. Gone from not having a plan and realizing that he needed one.  

**Room 2:** 
It can be helpful to have documents that detail responsibilities of each group member. Onedrive, dropbox, and cloud for sharing files. Git and related GUI tools for sharing code. Wrike for communication/ tracking tasks. 


**Room 3:** 
Many large projects, typically not managed well. In house, use Trello to share status of tasks. Google Drive to share folders and electronic notebooks. OneNote is cumbersome. Code sharing is an issue. Trello takes time but is being used. Working with industry helps with project management - since milestones etc are typical. Academic world is more challenging. Patient privacy issues is a challenge for streamlining this type of research. 

**Room 4:** 
Diverse experience largely with small and medium size projects. Two overarching strategies pertaining to project management: 
1) Various folders on shared server to separate projects/subfolders to separate parts of projects and naming conventions to guide version control
2) google docs to encourage dynamic collaboration

### Q2: How could a governance document or "lemons lab" have made a prior project more successful or easier to finish?

**Room 1:** 
Governance document sets up the project, allows the team to agree upon things, and can resolve conflicts.  Thinking about scale - maybe not necessary for smaller groups. Might be an issue if there is no project management assistance. We were lucky and had Tyson in our group - we ended up picking his brain :-)

**Room 2:** 
It's often helpful to have someone who moderates 'lemons lab' style meetings or check-ins to ensure that everyone gets an opportunity to speak/ contribute. 


**Room 3:** Agreement upfront could have sped 1) publication time w/r to turn-around time on draft revisions among co-authors, 2) meeting interim deadlines on projects to speed completion. Hard to anticipate barriers at the outset of project. Managing constructive criticism is challenging to receive/give well in a lemons-lab context. Coming together intentionally/planned to discuss interim-project progress can help address unanticipated problems.


**Room 4:** 
Could allow for easier onboarding of new team members, to provide rules for the lab, data collection etc. Sets protocols for team members to work together and to run a lab properly.

### Q3: Have you all used any of the project management tools discussed, or others not discussed, in your work?

**Room 1:** 
Trello - sometimes can see like more work but can also save you time and effort. Hasn't used them in the past but see's how it could be useful. Insterested in the Waterfall approach for design, grant submission, etc. 

**Room 2:** 


**Room 3:** Kan Ban boards can be set up within Jira & Zen Hub, which can organize discussions about tasks. Github issues makes these conversations around tasks public. 


**Room 4:** 
We haven't used any management software in the past. Seems like an upfront investment, would be curious to see what the benefits are. 

## Project Critique Activity

**What issues did you notice, and how might you address them?**

**Room 1:** 
1.) Project should have been a folder and filenaming/structure was too generic.  Also could use dates in filenames.
2.) variables names were too generic
3.) could have provided a description of the dataset - readme file
4.) could have put everything in a script and fixed the variable name in R so the image could be recreated later. 
5.) could have tested for null value, test the validity of his dataset in R - he had a missing observation and ignored the R warning.
6.) covered variable name in his document.
7.) Could have adjusted his axis and take a little more care in creating his visualization.
8.) taking a look at data outliers 
9.) We still don't know what var. 2 stands for. 


**Room 2:** 
No labeling in the plots, file names are not specific, no folders for the specific project with inputs and outputs separated-- potential issues with locating files in the future. Dating the files and keeping a notebook/ readme document that tracks all the changes would have been beneficial. 'Basecamp'- a software to communicate with different contributors of a project: with the current set-up others cannot replicate/ continue where the original contributor left off. 


**Room 3:** Download folder as junk drawer for everything. No metadata about who did what. File naming conventions not used, best-practice could be including the name of project and date of most recent revision. No information in RStudio or elsewhere about what the data are, so that a person could pick up where someone left off. No records kept about data-cleaning of the Excel sheet, unclear data columns. Versioning process of the datasheets and products not being done. Need to keep files in a single directory to streamline processes. No acknowledgement of future data needs, such as regenerating the image for publication. 


**Room 4:** 
Project management 
1) project not in folder (on desktop)
2) no naming conventions
4) muted the master data file without log 
5) variable names not infomative
6) makes changes to raw data without change log 
7) no metadata! what is the NULL value in his data? 
8) no data quality checks 
10) plot without axis or title
11) xaxis title muted via (innovative) workaround rather than var or attr lables
12) graph saved to desktop 
13) manual changes to plot without altering underlying code (was no code?)
14) non labeled plots once embedded in paper 
15) no version control 
16) format of figure as eps rather than png 
17) on document: no table 1, no review/revision process prior to submission
