## Discussion and notes

- **Static website:** 
    - html based *without* dynamically interacting with a database
    - Inclusion of blog doesn't constitute a dynamic website

- **Dynamic website:** 
    - think eCommerce, or search engines. You ask the website for some information, that interaction queries a database, the database agreggates content and serves it to you via their web interface

- **Q: What are advantages and disadvantages of using GitHub Pages or ReadtheDocs for documentation?**
A: Syntax is easier with GitHub Pages (it’s Markdown, like the HackMD; RTD uses ReStructured Text, which many find cumbersome), ReadTheDocs generates a well known layout for documentation (opinions of Michael and Ryan)

- Cloning vs. Forking: forking is serving someone else’s code to yourself, and cloning is copying your code to a new place. Any public repo can be forked.
