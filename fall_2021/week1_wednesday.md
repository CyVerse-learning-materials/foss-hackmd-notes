Format your question as a bullet point, an instructor will add a response as a sub-point, like this:

**Breakout Discussion questions & notes**

**Q1:** What constitutes OS? What does OS mean to you? Challenges to doing OS? What motivates you to do OS?

Room 1: 
- reproducibility is essential to OS. 
- Limitations to OS 
- issues with Int Property (IP), data, algorithms - can we release without impacting bottom line of the company. 
- “ No one does perfect OS”  — M. Culshaw-Mauer
- transparency, accessibility. How the data are collected, processed, getting access to data, so that you can reproduce. Process is not a black box. -Brandon
