## Discussion and notes

- **Static website:** 
    - html based *without* dynamically interacting with a database
    - Inclusion of blog doesn't consitute a dynamic website

- **Dynamic website:** 
    - think eCommerce, or search engines. You ask the website for some information, that interaction queries a database, the database agreggates content and serves it to you via their web interface
