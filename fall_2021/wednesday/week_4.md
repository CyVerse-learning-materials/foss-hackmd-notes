## Discussion and notes

**General notes**
- FAIR is important to you whether you know about it or not
- FAIR assessment tool: [https://ardc.edu.au/resources/working-with-data/fair-data/fair-self-assessment-tool/](https://ardc.edu.au/resources/working-with-data/fair-data/fair-self-assessment-tool/)
- Data Management plan tools:
    - www.dmptool.org
    - https://ds-wizard.org/

**Questions**

Eduardo:  Are the licenses valid in all countries? do they depend on some legislation?

## Breakout Discussion questions & notes

**Q: Which elements of FAIR do you struggle with? What particular challenges are there with making your dataset FAIR?**

*Room 1*

- don't fully understand how licensing data works or make metadata records accessible without making data available
- data would be hard to make public because it is sorced from many research groups
- 


*Room 2*
- Focusing on metadata standards that are field specific
- Accessibility issues within projects and externally
- Modeling is difficult to keep track of variable tuning and sample spaces, keeping track of parameter sweeps
- Have any of us actually worked with FAIR data?
    - NetCDF
    - Metadata usefulness is important
    - Municipal GIS data is very accessible



*Room 3*

- Vendor locked file format types limit reusability 
- institutional "red tape" or just slow processes in setting desired open license / usage rights for data and code.
- High cost to publish in open access journals
- Findability does not necessary mean, each data sample is identified. de-identified health data usually don't have identifiers other than general information (age, sex, ...)
- some journals won't publish a paper if its uploaded to an archive open access site before
- many vendors make sure their data is not operable without their proprietary software/hardware

*Room 4*

- metadata not necessarily machine-readable
- not using standardized ontologies
- I think F is way harder than AIR!

**Q: Have you ever prepared a DMP? How did it go? What elements/components did you revisit and why?**


Rm 1
- none of us have ever created a DMP
- Plan for one if we created one:
-Flow chart or if/else table to set end points and response to unforseen results
-Where the data will be stored while the project is ongoing. 
-Where data will be published (repositories) after the project is done.
-naming protocols
-common documentation/notes on errors and unexpected circumstances, etc.

Rm 2
- No formal DMP previously
    - *ad hoc* halfway through a study by putting files in a shared Box folder
    - Different naming conventions across groups
    - a few prior proposals but not translated to actual data management plan



Rm 3
- no one has done one
- licensing
- storage
- backup

Rm 4

- yes, as a required part of a grant
- helpful to plan it out for others involved in the project
- No, the closest I had done has some Standard Operation Procedures and preparing files for field evaluation.

### Homework Reminders

Homework link will be sent out by Friday!
