**Questions**

## Breakout Discussion questions & notes



### Q1: What are some tasks you have made more repeatable/automated?

**Room 1:** 

**Room 2:** 

- Data Curation
- 

**Room 3:** 
- Analysis in R and ArcGIS
- Relative working directories with R projects


### Q2: What are some tasks you would like to make more automated/repeatable? What challenges are involved?

**Room 1:** 

**Room 2:** 

- Data Curation, remove of outliers, create some barriers/limits during the data collection (min, max, categories available)

**Room 3:** 
- Repeated analysis on multiple variables that is slightly different
- Standardizing similar responses (yes/no answers; slight color differences of images)
- Data wrangling completely in R
- Using shared scripts/ confusing layouts and commenting


### Q3: Are there any things you sort of "cross your fingers and hope it works"?

**Room 1:** 

**Room 2:** 


**Room 3:** 
- Manually checking shapes selected in ArcGIS
- Working in teams, subjective responses
- Previously shody version control and hoping that I will understand it in the future (yikes!)

### Q4: Any experience with remote/cloud computing? Why? What platform? Any challenges?

**Room 1:** 

- HPCs have more up-to-date hardware, GPUs
- RAM limitations on local machines

**Room 2:** 

- University's BioHPC, SRA - NCBI, GPUs. Sharing data, running analysis.
I got some issues with the upload in SRA - NCBI, this issue was not documented.


**Room 3:** 
- University's HPC system

**Room 4:** 


### Q5: What are some perceived benefits to shifting more work to cloud/remote?

**Room 1:** 

**Room 2:** 

- No worries with maintenance, you can reserve the machine based on your needs.

**Room 3:** 
- Free resource at UA with support (HPC)
- Higher computing power

**Room 4:** 


### Q6: What are some perceived costs/challenges to shifting more work to cloud/remote?

**Room 1:** 

**Room 2:** 

- More related with the Learning, since the prices are cheap, in comparison with buying your machine.
- No needs to hire or training someone to make maintenance.

**Room 3:** 
- Limited computing power allocated/high demand from other users
- Learning specific university systems that might not apply in other situations
- Corporate control
- Learning curve

**Room 4:**
